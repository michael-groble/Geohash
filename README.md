# Geohash
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michael-groble/Geohash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michael-groble/Geohash)

Native Swift geohash package supporting binary and character encoding

I also have a [Rust version](https://github.com/michael-groble/Geohash-rust)

Geohashes are represented internally as 64 bit integers.  A hash can be constructed either using character
precision (up to 12 characters) or binary precision (up to 32 bits per angle).

```swift
GeohashBits(location: Location(longitude: -0.1, latitude: 51.5), characterPrecision: 12).hash()
=> "gcpuvxr1jzf"
GeohashBits(location: Location(longitude: -0.1, latitude: 51.5), bitPrecision: 26).hash()
=> "gcpuvxr1jz" 
```

Note that the last value is truncated at 10 characters (50 bits) even though the "full" representation is 
52 bits total.  Since the character encoding is Base32, we require 5 bits for each.

The Geohash boundaries and centroids are correctly handled when the character representation provides a 
different number of bits for latitude and longitude (e.g. geohash 7 which has 18 bits of longitude and 17 
bits of latitude).

```swift
GeohashBits(hash: "u10hfr2").boundingBox().center()
=> (longitude: 0.0995635986328125, latitude: 51.5004730224609)
```

This is the same answer you will get from PostGIS 

```sql
select ST_AsText(ST_PointFromGeoHash('u10hfr2'));
st_astext                  
--------------------------------------------
POINT(0.0995635986328125 51.5004730224609)
```

The library also supports computing neighbors

```swift
GeohashBits(hash: "u10hfr2c4pv").neighbor(.north).hash()
=> "u10hfr2c60j"
```
